# 💉 Diabetes Prediction Model

A simple supervised machine learning project that predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on medical diagnostic measurements.  
This project uses **Logistic Regression** — a classification algorithm — trained on the popular **Diabetes Dataset** from Kaggle.

## 📊 Dataset

Dataset sourced from Kaggle:  
👉 [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

It contains medical measurements from women of Pima Indian heritage, including:

- Number of Pregnancies
- Plasma Glucose Concentration
- Diastolic Blood Pressure
- Triceps Skinfold Thickness
- Serum Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age  
- **Outcome** (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## 💡 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Model training using `LogisticRegression`.
- Model evaluation with `Accuracy Score` and `Classification Report`.
- 🎯 **Interactive User Input Mode:**  
  When you run the script, you can enter real health measurements manually, like this:

```
--- Diabetes Prediction ---
Enter number of pregnancies: 3
Enter glucose level: 120
Enter diastolic blood pressure: 70
Enter skin thickness: 22
Enter insulin level: 85
Enter BMI: 24.5
Enter Diabetes Pedigree Function: 0.5
Enter age: 32

Prediction Result: Not Diabetic
```
